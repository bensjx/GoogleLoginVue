## How to use:

1. Go to firebase console, under develop -> authentication -> sign-in methods, enable google login.
2. Under the google login portion, go to Web Client ID. This is your clientID.
3. In index.html, under change clientID to your OWN clientID.

## Note:

You MIGHT not be able to run this in codesandbox as you will receive a 'popup-closed-by user
error'. However if you refresh or use a new browser or clear your cache it might work again.<br>
Solution: Finish your code, commit to github, and run your web page using github hosted pages.
It should work from there
